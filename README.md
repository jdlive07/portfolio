## Installation

Install Node.js from [here](http://nodejs.org/).

Once node is installed we are going to need some tools. Follow
the installation instructions for the following tools.

- [bower](http://bower.io/)
- [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

Now we need to install our project dependancies. Npm and Bower
make this **super** simple! Just run the following from within
the project.  

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
